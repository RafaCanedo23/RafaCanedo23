Hi, 
I'm Rafael CaÃ±edo, Mexican, 29 (almost).

- I'm insterested in Data Science & Analytics, specially applied to sports
- I'm currently pursuing a master degree in Data Science @ITESO
- I just created my Git profile to share my experiences and developments I've been making on my own.
- I'm looking for profesional experiences on Data Science, again, if in sports would be my dream.
